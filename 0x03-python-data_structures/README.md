### This project in the Higher Level Programming series is about:

 * What are lists and how to use them
 * What are the differences and similarities between strings and lists
 * What are the most common methods of lists and how to use them
 * How to use lists as stacks and queues
 * What are list comprehensions and how to use them
 * What are tuples and how to use them
 * When to use tuples versus lists
 * What is a sequence
 * What is tuple packing
 * What is sequence unpacking

 * All your files should end with a new line
 * Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
 * You are not allowed to use global variables

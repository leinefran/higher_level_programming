# 0x0B. Python - Input/Output

### This project in the Higher Level Programming series is about:

 * How to open a file
 * How to write text in a file
 * How to read the full content of a file
 * How to read a file line by line
 * How to move the cursor in a file
 * How to make sure a file is closed after using it
 * What is and how to use the with statement
 * What is JSON
 * What is serialization
 * What is deserialization
 * How to convert a Python data structure to a JSON string
 * How to convert a JSON string to a Python data structure

## Requirements for Python scripts
 * Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
 * All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
 * All your files should end with a new line
 * The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
 * A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
 * Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.*)
 * All your files must be executable
 * The length of your files will be tested using wc

## Requirements for Python test cases

 * Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
 * All your files should end with a new line
 * All your test files should be inside a folder tests
 * All your test files should be text files (extension: .txt)
 * All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m doctest ./tests/*
 * All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
 * All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
 * All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
 * We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case

# 0x0C. Python - Almost a circle

### This project in the Higher Level Programming series is about:

 * What is Unit testing and how to implement it in a large project
 * How to serialize and deserialize a Class
 * How to write and read a JSON file
 * What is *args and how to use it
 * What is **kwargs and how to use it
 * How to handle named arguments in a function

## Requirements for Python scripts
 * Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
 * All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
 * All your files should end with a new line
 * The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
 * A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
 * Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.*)
 * All your files must be executable
 * The length of your files will be tested using wc
 * All your modules should be documented: python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'
 * All your classes should be documented: python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'
 * All your functions (inside and outside a class) should be documented: python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'

## Requirements for Python unit tests

 * Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
 * All your files should end with a new line
 * All your test files should be inside a folder tests
 * You have to use the unittest module
 * All your test files should be python files (extension: .py)
 * All your test files and folders should start with test_
 * Your file organization in the tests folder should be the same as your project: ex: for models/base.py, unit tests must be in: tests/test_models/test_base.py
 * All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m unittest discover tests
 * You can also test file by file by using this command: python3 -m unittest tests/test_models/test_base.py
 * We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases so that you donâ€™t miss any edge case

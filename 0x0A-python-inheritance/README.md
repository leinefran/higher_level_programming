# 0x0A. Python - Inheritance

### This project in the Higher Level Programming series is about:

 * What is a superclass, baseclass or parentclass
 * What is a subclass
 * How to list all attributes and methods of a class or instance
 * When can an instance have new attributes
 * How to inherit class from another
 * How to define a class with multiple base classes
 * What is the default class every class inherit from
 * How to override a method or attribute inherited from the base class
 * Which attributes or methods are available by heritage to subclasses
 * What is the purpose of inheritance
 * What are, when and how to use isinstance, issubclass, type and super built-in functions

## Requirements for Python scripts
 * Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
 * All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
 * All your files should end with a new line
 * The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
 * A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
 * Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.*)
 * All your files must be executable
 * The length of your files will be tested using wc

## Requirements for Python test cases

 * Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
 * All your files should end with a new line
 * All your test files should be inside a folder tests
 * All your test files should be text files (extension: .txt)
 * All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m doctest ./tests/*
 * All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
 * All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
 * All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
 * We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you donâ€™t miss any edge case

# higher level programming - Python
This repository contains projects for training Python programming. Most projects are in python and are designed to learn python from beginning level to advanced level. Some projects are in C and are designed to learn Data Structure and Algorithms.

## Coding style
- All python files are interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3) and use the [PEP 8 style (version 1.7.*)](https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle) for checking coding style
- All text files are executable with exactly two lines long and are tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- All C files are compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and using [Betty Style](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty) for checking coding and documentation styles.

## Getting started
To use, first download this repository into your local machine by issuing the following command in your local terminal.
```
git clone https://github.com/leinefran/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming.git
```
#### Directory
Each directoy's name includes information below
1. a number which orders projects from beginning to advanced level
2. name of programming language
3. concept/topic.
#### Change Directory
```
cd <directory name>
```
After change current working directory, issue the following command to compile the code

* Run .py file
```
python3 <filename.py>
```
or
```
./<filename.py>
```
* Run text file
```
./<filename>
```
* Run .c file
```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic <filename.c> -o <output filename>
```
Once the .c files are compiled you can run the program by issuing the command
```
./<output filename>
```
